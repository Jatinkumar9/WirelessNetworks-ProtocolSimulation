# WirelessNetworks-Security-ProtocolSimulation
Project Related to the Simulation of Wireless Netwoks and Security where different Protocols are implemented to compare results

For now, only the DSDV Protocol is implemented and further AODV Protocol shall be added and the results shall be compared to the research paper - Highly Dynamic Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) for Mobile Computers (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2734335_Highly_Dynamic_Destination-Sequenced_Distance-Vector_Routing_DSDV_for_Mobile_Computers/link/54984a610cf2eeefc30f90b4/)
