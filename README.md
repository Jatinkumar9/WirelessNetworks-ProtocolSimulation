# WirelessNetworks-Security-ProtocolSimulation
Project Related to the Simulation of Wireless Netwoks and Security where different Protocols are implemented to compare results


For now, only the DSDV Protocol is implemented and further AODV Protocol shall be added and the results shall be compared to the research paper - Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3561/)
